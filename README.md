# Search-SortMethodsUsingC
This is a example program I made on how to understand how  Bubble/Insertion/Selection sorts work and also how Linear/Binary searches work in a program using a student record

Description -:

 This is a program which reads a file which contains student name in first column which is a string, student age (integer), student birth year (integer) and finally the mark they obtained (double). After reading the file the data in it is stored in a structure array with a size of 10. In the program, when the user selects the first option, it displays all the stored data in the array. By choosing the second option, it gives the user to choose which order the sorted array should be (ascending / descending) and after choosing it, again the system gives the user to choose the technique that the program should use to sort the array (bubble sort / insertion sort / selection sort). The third option is to search for a specific student name in the array and display all the data regarding the student. When the user selects the third option, the program asks the user how the search key should be searched in the array (linear search / binary search). The fifth option stores all the data in the structure array into a linked list and print all the nodes in it. And finally, by the last option the program is terminated.
